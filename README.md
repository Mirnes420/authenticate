Setting up a Protected Area for a Django Website

# Introducion
This document provides instruction on how to set up a protected area in a Django website project.This is useful when you want to restrict access to certain parts of your webpage to authenticated users only.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
<ul>
  <li>Python installed on your system.</li>
  <li>Django installed in your Python environment.</li>
  <li>A Django project set up and go.</li>
</ul>

# Steps 
<ol>
<li><strong>Set Up Authentication:</strong> Django comes with a built-in user authentiation system. You can use this to handle user registration, login, and logout. Follow the official Django documentation to set this up.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Login View:</strong> If you don't have one, create a view where users can log in. This can be a form that takes a username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Protect your views:</strong> In the views that you want to protect, use @login_required decorator. This will ensure that only logged in users can access the view.
  
  <code>from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    # Your view logic here</code>

As an alternative, you can manually check if the user is authenticated.

<code>def my_protected_view(request):
    if not request.user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect('login')
    # Your view logic here
</code>
<i>In this code <code>request.user.is_authenticated</code> will return <code>True</code> if the user is logged in and <code>False</code> otherwise. In that case, user is redirected to the login page.</i></li>
<li><strong>Update Your URLs:</strong>  In your <strong>urls.py</strong> file, make sure that Django knows where your login view is. You can do this by setting the <strong>LOGIN_URL</strong> setting.

<code>from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', views.login_view, name='login'),
    # Your other urls here
]</code></li>
<li><strong>Test:</strong> Finally, test your protected area by trying to access the protected views. If youâ€™re not logged in, Django should redirect you to the login page.</li></ol>

# Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to set up a basic protected area in your Django website project.
